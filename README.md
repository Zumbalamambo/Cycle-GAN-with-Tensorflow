A clean Implementation of Conditional Cycle GAN. Things are working well. Also this is the base code of my repository Face Aging with cycleGAN. I'm still working at cycleGAN on face aging.

Thanks to the reference code of XHUJOY(https://github.com/XHUJPY/CycleGAN-tensorflow) and junyanz(https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN)
