A clean Implementation of Cycle GAN. Things are working well. Also this is the base code of my repository Face Aging with cycleGAN. I'm still on how to apply cycleGAN on face aging.

I've finished the model structure of conditional cycle GAN. Thanks to the reference code of XHUJOY(https://github.com/XHUJPY/CycleGAN-tensorflow) and junyanz(https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN)
